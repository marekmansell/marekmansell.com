I offer engaging, hands-on courses designed to bring STEM and physical computing to life through project-based learning. Using tools like the BBC micro:bit and Arduino, my courses empower educators and students to explore coding, electronics, and creative problem-solving in fun and accessible ways. Whether you're new to these technologies or looking to deepen your skills, each course is structured to be practical, inspiring, and directly applicable in the classroom.
